This Matlab code is used to determine the pressure distribution over a surface using the shock expansion theory. Keeping in line with the theory, the nose deflection angle has to be selected below the maximum
deflection angle for that Mach number. The surface is not defined by the geometry but rather the deflection at each segments.
